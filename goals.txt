# Goals for Drill-Down Feature Implementation

## Original User Request
"I want to add a drill-down feature. After viewing the totals, users should be able to click to see employee-level data in a table format. The table should be sorted by last name and show first name, emp_id, and the selected fields. There should also be a CSV download option. For non-aggregated data (separate periods), each pay period should be displayed separately with its own CSV download."

## Confirmed Requirements

### 1. Drill-Down Functionality
- After viewing analytics totals, users can click to see detailed employee-level data
- Seamless transition from aggregated view to detailed view

### 2. Table Format Display
- Display data in a sortable table with:
  - Employee information (first name, last name, emp_id)
  - Selected payslip fields from the analytics session
  - Sorted by last name by default
  - Clean, readable format

### 3. CSV Download Functionality
- Export functionality for the drill-down data
- Download button for easy data export
- Properly formatted CSV with headers

### 4. Period Handling
- For non-aggregated data (separate periods view):
  - Show each pay period separately
  - Individual CSV downloads for each period
  - Clear period identification

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Components
- New endpoints for drill-down data retrieval
- CSV export functionality
- Proper handling of encrypted fields with AES_DECRYPT
- Support for all existing filters (payroll groups, departments, etc.)

### Frontend Components
- New DrillDown.vue component with table display
- Download functionality integration
- Router updates to support drill-down navigation
- Integration with existing analytics flow

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain consistency with existing parameter naming
- Handle encrypted payslip fields properly
- Support all existing filter combinations
- Responsive design matching existing UI patterns

## Success Criteria
- Users can navigate from analytics to drill-down seamlessly
- Employee data is displayed in a clear, sortable table
- CSV downloads work correctly for all data types
- Performance is acceptable with proper database indexing
- All existing functionality remains intact
