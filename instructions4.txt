- we now have somewhat good working code on visualization for some payslip fields. what we want to do is not mess with that code at all
    now, but what we want to provide the user the ability to select the fields they want to work with to visualize. this will require a 
    field selection page immediately after selecting the company. here i envision that we provide the user three general areas to analyze
    which are 'amounts', 'hours' and 'taxes'. we will need to study the payslip table schema and have a permanent mapping of which fields
    belong to which grouping and a human readable (not field names) alias for these fields that the user can choose from

- once we have this page, we can then proceed to the pages as we currently have them where next page would be for the user to select a
    specific employee or all and we continue from there, but not what we will be querrying is not static as we have it right now but
    dynamically determined by the selection of the user described above

- once we have these two things done, we need to change the dynamic log scale methodology we have in place. effectively, what will happen 
    with choosing what fields to visualize is that the values will vary significantly. if user decides to analyze all of pay, then one can
    that value for all of the company for an entire year will have a sizable total vs if user decides to analyze ot, nsd and holiday pay only
    for one employee only and for one period. so we may have to, as always, have 0 as the bottom and highest value as top rung and do log scale
    based on that

- once done here, we want to go to the analytics page and have a download button / facility there. let's implement this and see what outputs 
    look like (csv)
