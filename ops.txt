we are using python3, specifically, 3.13. understand this

there is already a virtual environment. do not mess this up. the venv must be activated before running 
    backend: cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python3 app.py

a lot of data is encrypted. aes decrypt is used. the key is in already in .env of backend repo

similarly, credentials to db access is in .env of backend not main repo

do not mess with the port assignments. we just insure before starting up the backend and frontend, all
    process are killed and all ports are available:  
    kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000,5000) 2>/dev/null || true && pkill -f "node.*" && pkill -f "python.*app.py"

there is python dictionary with nested dataclasses`payslip_fields.py` that reflects mapping from
    payslip_fields_mapping.txt

when we push up to github, we add and commit at all the folder levels, but only push (everything) at root directory level
