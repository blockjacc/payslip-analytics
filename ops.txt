we are using python3, specifically, 3.13. understand this

there is already a virtual environment. do not mess this up. the venv must be activated before running 
    backend: cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python3 app.py

a lot of data is encrypted. aes decrypt is used. please take extra note of this and see how this is already implemented and do not 
stray from it. in all the documentation of the tables in the db, e denotes encrypted fields and n identified non-encrypted fields.
the key is in already in .env of backend repo

similarly, credentials to db access is in .env of backend not main repo

do not mess with the port assignments. we just insure before starting up the backend and frontend, all
    process are killed and all ports are available:  
    kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000,5000) 2>/dev/null || true && pkill -f "node.*" && pkill -f "python.*app.py"

there is python dictionary with nested dataclasses`payslip_fields.py` that reflects mapping from
    payslip_fields_mapping.txt

we do lint and type-check on backend and scan for undefined variables before running all the time
