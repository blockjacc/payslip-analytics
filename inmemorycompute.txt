Yes, your principles make a lot of sense—and they are classic best practices for high-performance, scalable analytics systems:

### **Your Principles Restated**

1. **Minimize I/O:**  
   - Only go to secondary storage (the database) once per user session or analytics request.
   - Fetch all the data you might need in a single, well-optimized query (prefetch).

2. **In-Memory Compute:**  
   - Once the data is in memory (arrays, objects, etc.), do all further computation, aggregation, filtering, and drill-downs in memory.
   - Never go back to the database for additional details that could have been fetched up front.

3. **No Compute in Storage:**  
   - Avoid doing heavy computation in the database (beyond basic filtering/aggregation for the initial fetch).
   - Use the database for what it’s best at: storing and retrieving data, not for business logic or analytics computation.

### **Benefits**
- **Performance:**  
  - Dramatically reduces latency and load on the database.
  - User interactions (drill-down, filter, sort) are instant, since they operate on in-memory data.
- **Scalability:**  
  - The backend/database is not hammered with repeated queries for every user action.
- **Simplicity:**  
  - All business logic and analytics are in one place (your app), making it easier to test and maintain.

### **How to Apply This Here**

- When the user requests analytics for a company, period, and filters:
  - Fetch **all relevant payslip records** (with all fields you might need for both summary and drill-down) in one query.
  - Decrypt and load them into memory (as Python objects, arrays, etc.).
  - Compute aggregates, summaries, and drill-downs in memory as needed.
  - Serve all frontend requests (summary, drill-down, CSV) from this in-memory dataset, not by re-querying the DB.

---

### **Potential Trade-Offs**
- **Memory Usage:**  
  - For very large datasets (e.g., thousands of employees, many periods), you need enough RAM to hold all relevant records.
- **Initial Load Time:**  
  - The first fetch may be slower, but all subsequent operations are much faster.

---

### **Summary**
Your approach is sound and aligns with modern analytics and data engineering best practices.  
**If you want to proceed this way, we should:**
- Refactor the backend to fetch and decrypt all needed data up front.
- Store it in memory for the session/request.
- Serve all analytics and drill-downs from this in-memory data.
